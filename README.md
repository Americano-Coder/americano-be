## Django Expense Tracker API
This is a Django project that provides a backend API for managing expenses. The API allows you to save expenses to the database, retrieve all expenses with specific filters, and get specific expenses based on their IDs.

Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Create a new database in PostgreSQL.

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
